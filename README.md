# Empire Politics Region Return Dilemma Fix - Mixer Sub-Mod
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. A compatibility sub-mod for my Empire Politics Region Return Dilemma Fix mod and Mixu's Mixer. Ensures that Mixer doesn't prevent region return dilemmas from occurring.

**_IMPORTANT!_** Make sure that this mod is positioned **ABOVE** both the base Region Return Dilemma Fix mod *and* Mixer in the Mod Manager:

You should see them listed in this order in the subsequent warning message:

This is required in order to override Mixer's version of the politics script (which adds back CA's 2.3.0 workaround).

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894576973). Releases added here to support other platforms.
